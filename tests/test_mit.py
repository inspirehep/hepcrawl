        'serve to pin the Fermi energy. In our organic-metal work, we explore '
        'the complexity and challenges of modeling these systems. For example, '
        'we confirm that aromatic compounds indeed have stronger interactions '
        'with metal surfaces, but this may lead to the geometry changing as a '
        'result of the interaction. We also find that molecules that are not '
        'rigid are strongly affected by their neighboring molecules. Surface '
        'roughness will have an effect on molecules that more strongly bind to '
        'metal surfaces. This study of interfaces relates to one part of the '
        'picture of efficiency, but we also look at trying to go beyond the '
        'Shockley-Quiesser limit. We explore the idea of combining a direct and '
        'indirect bandgap in a single material but find that, in quasi-'
        'equilibrium, this does no better than just the direct gap material. '
