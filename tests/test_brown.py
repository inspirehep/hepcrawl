        "There exists a fluidic version of the electrostatic field-effect, by "
        "which the transport of ions and charged objects in solution can be "
        "controlled in nanoscale channels. In this dissertation, we present a "
        "theory of such \"electrofluidic\" gating, the fabrication of "
        "electrically articulated nanopore devices that can exploit it, and "
        "measurements of ionic and DNA transport that quantify the effect. The "
        "basic idea behind electrofluidic gating is that the charge on a metal "
        "electrode beneath an insulating layer can induce electric fields in a "
        "thin layer of fluid above it. The fundamental structure for "
        "electrofluidic gating is a metal-oxide-electrolyte (MOE) capacitor, "
        "whose charging grants control over the electric double layer of the "
        "fluid. In this dissertation, we first present a model for the charging "
        "behavior of the MOE capacitor. Our model emphasizes the chemistry of "
        "oxide surfaces. We next describe fabrication of nanopore devices with "
        "embedded electrodes by focused ion beam and transmission electron "
        "microscope. Studies of the milling rate and its dependence on the "
        "electron flux identified sputtering as the dominant erosion mechanism. "
        "Next we describe experiments of gating the ionic conductance of a "
        "nanopore with an embedded gate electrode. The induced swings in the "
        "conductance showed strong dependencies on the pH and the ionic "
        "strength of the solution that are well described by our model. The "
        "absence of gate leakage currents confirmed the purely electrostatic "
        "origin of this field-effect. Finally, we demonstrate field-effect "
        "control over DNA translocations in a gated nanopore. The capture of "
        "DNA from solution was facilitated by the application of a positive "
        "charge to the embedded gate electrode, and the average translocation "
        "speed increased. These effects are explained by the reduced effective "
        "size of the nanopore due to electrostatic repulsion of DNA from its "
        "charged walls and by the modified electro-osmotic flow. This picture "
        "is consistent with the reduced capture rate and the increased average "
        "translocation speed of DNA as we increased the Debye length. Gated "
        "nanopore devices thus begin to mimic the single-molecule regulatory "
        "capabilities of biological nanopores, and suggest new avenues for "
        "fundamental studies and technological applications."
