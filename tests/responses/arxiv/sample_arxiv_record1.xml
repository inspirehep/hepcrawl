domain of high-energy astrophysics and particle physics. We discuss the
highest-energy neutrino detection and its interpretation after 4 years of data.
The significance is such that the discovery of a non terrestrial component can
be claimed but its origin is not yet clarified. The high energy non-atmospheric
component is seen also in other analyses with smaller significance, for
instance when using muon neutrino induced events coming from the Northern
hemisphere. Flavor mixing is probed along cosmic distances in an analysis using
also cascade neutrino events. The results on the search for neutrino sources is
presented including the results of a joint analysis with Pierre Auger and
Telescope Array which is sensitive to correlations between highest energy
neutrinos and UHECRs measured by the three experiments. Moreover, recent
results on dark matter searches from the Sun are discussed. Finally, the
results on standard neutrino oscillations are presented.
