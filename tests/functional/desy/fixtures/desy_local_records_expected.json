The error bars correspond to the extremal values of the multidimensional 68\\% confidence region for each fit. The theoretical relations are shown as red lines and their 1$\\sigma$ and 2$\\sigma$ scatter are represented by the dark and light grey bands, respectively. The mass-concentration relation from \\cite{maccio08} and the stellar mass-halo mass relation from \\cite{behroozi13} are also shown as the black dashed lines.",

Towards the development of an integrated 1 MeV electron accelerator based on dielectric laser accelerator technologies, development in several relevant technologies is needed. In this work, recent developments on electron sources, bunching, accelerating, focussing, deflecting and laser coupling structures are reported. With an eye to the near future, components required for a 1 MeV kinetic energy tabletop accelerator producing sub-femtosecond electron bunches are outlined."
