The devices were also cooled down to 170 K to observe dark count dependence on temperature. No dependencies on the direction of an applied 3.2 kV/cm electric field were observed with respect to dark-count rate, gain, or photon detection efficiency."

The focus lies on an observer O interrogating a system S with binary questions and S's state is taken as O's `catalogue of knowledge' about S. The mathematical tools of the framework are simple and we attempt to highlight all underlying assumptions. Four rules are imposed, asserting (1) a limit on the amount of information available to O; (2) the mere existence of complementary information; (3) O's total amount of information to be preserved in-between interrogations; and, (4) O's `catalogue of knowledge' to change continuously in time in-between interrogations and every consistent such evolution to be possible. This approach permits a constructive derivation of quantum theory, elucidating how the ensuing independence, complementarity and compatibility structure of O's questions matches that of projective measurements in quantum theory, how entanglement and monogamy of entanglement, non-locality and, more generally, how the correlation structure of arbitrarily many qubits and rebits arises. The rules yield a reversible time evolution and a quadratic measure, quantifying O's information about S. Finally, it is shown that the four rules admit two solutions for the simplest case of a single elementary system: the Bloch ball and disc as state spaces for a qubit and rebit, respectively, together with their symmetries as time evolution groups. The reconstruction for arbitrarily many qubits is completed in a companion paper (arXiv:1511.01130) where an additional rule eliminates the rebit case. This approach is inspired by (but does not rely on) the relational interpretation and yields a novel formulation of quantum theory in terms of questions."

The dominant annihilation process, for the DM particle is through the $B-L$ symmetry breaking scalar to right-handed neutrino pair. We exploit the effect of decay and inverse decay of the right-handed neutrino in thermal relic abundance of the DM. Depending on the values of the decay rate, the DM relic density can be significantly different from what is obtained in the standard calculation assuming the right-handed neutrino is in thermal equilibrium and there appear different regions of the parameter space satisfying the observed DM relic density. For a DM mass less than $\\mathcal{O}$(TeV), the direct detection experiments impose a competitive bound on the mass of the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge boson $Z^\\prime$ with the collider experiments. Utilizing the non-observation of the displaced vertices arising from the right-handed neutrino decays, bound on the mass of $Z^\\prime$ has been obtained at present and higher luminosities at the LHC with 14 TeV centre of mass energy where an integrated luminosity of 100fb$^{-1}$ is sufficient to probe $m_{Z'} \\sim 5.5$ TeV."

For all R-parity violating couplings, we discuss the evolution of the particle spectra through the renormalization group equations and the nature of the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) within the CMSSM, as an example of a specific complete supersymmetric model. We use the nature of the LSP to classify the possible signatures. For each possible scenario we present in detail the current LHC bounds on the supersymmetric particle masses, typically obtained using simplified models. From this we determine the present coverage of R-parity violating models at the LHC. We find several gaps, in particular for a stau-LSP, which is easily obtained in R-parity violating models. Using the program CheckMATE we recast existing LHC searches to set limits on the parameters of all R-parity violating CMSSMs. We find that virtually all of them are either more strongly constrained or similarly constrained in comparison to the R-parity conserving CMSSM, including the $\\bar U\\bar D\\bar D$ models. For each R-parity violating CMSSM we then give the explicit lower mass bounds on all relevant supersymmetric particles."
