abstract: Somatic BRAF mutation in colon cancer essentially excludes Lynch
  syndrome. We compared BRAF V600E immunohistochemistry (IHC) with BRAF
  mutation in core, biopsy, and whole-section slides to determine whether
  IHC is similar and to assess the cost-benefit of IHC. Resection cases
  (2009-2013) with absent MLH1 and PMS2 and prior BRAF mutation polymerase
  chain reaction results were chosen (n = 57). To mimic biopsy specimens,
  tissue microarrays (TMAs) were constructed. In addition, available biopsies
  performed prior to the resection were available in 15 cases. BRAF V600E IHC
  was performed and graded on TMAs, available biopsy specimens, and
  whole-section slides. Mutation status was compared with IHC, and
  cost-benefit analysis was performed. BRAF V600E IHC was similar in TMAs,
  biopsy specimens, and whole-section slides, with only four (7%) showing
  discordance between IHC and mutation status. Using BRAF V600E IHC in our
  Lynch syndrome screening algorithm, we found a 10% cost savings compared
  with mutational analysis. BRAF V600E IHC was concordant between TMAs,
  biopsy specimens, and whole-section slides, suggesting biopsy specimens are
  as useful as whole sections. IHC remained cost beneficial compared with
  mutational analysis, even though more patients needed additional molecular
  testing to exclude Lynch syndrome.
