HEPcrawl is a harvesting library based on Scrapy (http://scrapy.org) for INSPIRE-HEP
(http://inspirehep.net) that focuses on automatic and semi-automatic retrieval of
new content from all the sources the site aggregates. In particular content from
major and minor publishers in the field of High-Energy Physics.

The project is currently in early stage of development.
