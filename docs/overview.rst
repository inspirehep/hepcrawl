What is HEPcrawl?
=================

HEPcrawl is a Scrapy (http://scrapy.org) based crawler and acts as the service
responsible for harvesting High-Energy Physics contents for INSPIRE-HEP. HEPcrawl
is periodically triggered by INSPIRE to perform harvesting from sources and HEPcrawl
then pushes JSON records back to INSPIRE ingestion workflows.
